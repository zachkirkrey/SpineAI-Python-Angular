# Carya

A simple python app for annotating surgical outcomes based on ingested CSVs.

CSV goes in, CSV comes out.

## Getting Started

The app makes strict assumptions on the input CSV format, based on a template provided by Bilwaj. Ask Billy for details or inspect the code.

1. Clone repo or download main.py.
2. Move input CSV file as "heap_template.csv" into the same folder as main.py.
3. Run "python3 main.py"
4. Do your thing.

### Naming

Going with the Greek theme of Theseus AI, named after a famous seer, [Carya of Laconia][carya], as this app builds insight. :P
